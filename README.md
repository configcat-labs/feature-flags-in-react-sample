# Using Feature Flags in a React.js Application

This is a companion application for the blog post titled [**Using Feature Flags in a React.js Application**](https://configcat.com/blog/2021/12/13/feature-flags-in-react/).

This app demonstrates the use of [ConfigCat's Feature Flags](https://configcat.com/docs/) in a React application, showcasing how a feature flag can be used to toggle three cars racing towards a finish line.

## Build & Run

1. Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:configcat-labs/feature-flags-in-react-sample.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Run the app in development mode:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

4. To build the app for production, execute:

```shell
npm run build
```

This command correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more information.
